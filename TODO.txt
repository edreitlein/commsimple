Change topBar to use cookies instead of php session?

passwords should be hashed

get google login working

make the "createUserBackend" which takes email from createUserFrontend.php and checks if account exists, if not creates an account

change createUserFronted javascript to not allow blank entries

sanitize inputs from input boxes, specifically account creation

change topBar.php to only do the maintaining login code
